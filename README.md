# Pulse-Generator-using-tanner
(The given Circuit is implented using technology below 250n)

Given a Pulse Generator block which is implemented in a PLL(Phase locked loop) circuit along with other components (adders, ALU's, Memory units and etc)

Objective:
To get the repective delays = 
1) Buffer 1 = 120ps
2) Inverter = 40ps
3) Buffer 2 = 120ps
4) Buffer 4 = 190ps

Aim : To get a near optimised delay output using a 250n technology constraint and give justification as to why its the best values to get the delay output
