1) Pulse generator DUP_1 is the tuned and final version (case 4 in the report)
2) Pulse generator DUP_4 has NAND gate without any tuning done to it (Hence we see the drag in rise time in the output (X) waveform) (Case 1,2,3 are based on this design)

in case of any output delay error, refer the 'W' values from the table:
