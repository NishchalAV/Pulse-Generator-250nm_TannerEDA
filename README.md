# Pulse-Generator-using-tanner
(The given Circuit is implented using technology below 250n)

Given a Pulse Generator block which is implemented in a PLL(Phase locked loop) circuit along with other components (adders, ALU's, Memory units and etc)

Objective:
To get the repective delays = 
1) Buffer 1 = 120ps
2) Inverter = 40ps
3) Buffer 2 = 120ps
4) Buffer 4 = 190ps

---> To get the above delay output using a 250n technology constraint.
